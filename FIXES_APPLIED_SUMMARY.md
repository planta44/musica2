# 🎉 ALL FIXES APPLIED - COMPLETE SUMMARY

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Thumbnails Not Displaying on Live Page** ✓
**Problem:** Uploaded images showed as default icons instead of actual images.  
**Cause:** Backend returns relative URLs (`/uploads/filename`) but frontend tried to load them from frontend server (port 5173) instead of backend (port 3001).  
**Solution:**
- Created `frontend/src/lib/utils.js` with `getMediaUrl()` function that converts relative URLs to absolute URLs
- Updated all pages to use `getMediaUrl()` for images:
  - `Home.jsx` - Hero images, music thumbnails, merch images
  - `Music.jsx` - Music item thumbnails
  - `Videos.jsx` - Video thumbnails
  - `Merch.jsx` - Product images

### 2. **Upload MP3 and MP4 Files** ✓
**Problem:** File size limit was too small (10MB) for audio/video files.  
**Solution:**
- Increased upload limit from 10MB to 100MB in `backend/src/routes/upload.js`
- Added support for more audio formats: `mp3, m4a, aac, ogg, wav`
- Added support for more video formats: `mp4, mov, avi, webm`
- Improved file type validation to check MIME types

### 3. **Social Media Links & Contact Email** ✓
**Problem:** No way to set social media URLs and contact email.  
**Solution:**
- Added fields to `SiteSettings` schema:
  - `contactEmail`
  - `instagramUrl`
  - `facebookUrl`
  - `twitterUrl`
  - `youtubeUrl`
  - `spotifyUrl`
  - `appleMusicUrl`
  - `soundcloudUrl`
  - `tiktokUrl`
- Added "Contact & Social Media" section in Admin Settings with all fields

### 4. **Fan Club Fee Can Be Set to Zero** ✓
**Problem:** Fan Club fee defaulted to $5 with no way to make it free.  
**Solution:**
- Changed `fanClubAccessFee` default from `5.0` to `0.0` in schema
- Admin can now set it to 0 to make Fan Club free (removes payment process automatically)

### 5. **Color Scheme Not Saving to Live Page** ✓
**Problem:** Color changes in Settings weren't persisting.  
**Solution:**
- Fixed `backend/src/routes/content.js` - Settings update route now properly returns updated settings
- Added error logging for debugging
- Ensured real-time updates via WebSocket and SSE

### 6. **Background Photo Upload for Landing Page** ✓
**Problem:** Already existed but may not have been working due to URL issue.  
**Solution:**
- Fixed via `getMediaUrl()` utility - hero images now display correctly
- Can upload via "Hero Media URL (Desktop)" and "Hero Media URL (Mobile)" fields in Settings

## 🔧 CRITICAL: Database Migration Required

You MUST run this command to add the new fields to your database:

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_social_media_and_contact_fields
```

Or if that doesn't work:
```bash
cd backend
npx prisma db push
```

**After migration:**
1. Restart backend server (Ctrl+C, then `npm run dev`)
2. Refresh admin dashboard
