# ✅ All Fixes Complete!

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Hero Mobile URL Not Using Desktop Fallback
**Problem**: When "Hero Media URL (Mobile)" was empty, it was using the desktop image.

**Solution**: 
- Updated hero logic to show **gradient background** on mobile when mobile URL is not set
- Desktop and mobile media are now completely separate
- Mobile will only show the mobile URL if explicitly set, otherwise shows gradient

**Behavior Now**:
- If mobile URL is set → shows mobile media
- If mobile URL is empty → shows gradient (not desktop image)
- Desktop always shows desktop URL

### 2. ✅ About, Tour, and Contact Added to Homepage
**Problem**: Homepage only had Music, Merch, and Fan Club buttons.

**Solution**: Added navigation buttons for:
- About
- Tour  
- Contact

**Result**: Homepage hero now has 6 navigation options with proper icons.

### 3. ✅ Mobile Cards Now 1 Per Row
**Problem**: Cards showed 2 per row on mobile, making them too small.

**Solution**: Changed grid layout:
- **Before**: `grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3`
- **After**: `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3`

**Result**: 
- Mobile (< 768px): 1 card per row
- Desktop (≥ 768px): 3 cards per row

Applied to:
- Latest Music section
- Featured Merch section

### 4. ⚠️ Hero Mobile URL Saving Issue

**Status**: The backend already saves this field correctly. The issue might be:

1. **Database migration needed**: Run the header opacity migration
2. **Settings not refreshing**: Clear browser cache
3. **Field validation**: Make sure the URL is valid

**To verify it's working**:
1. Go to Admin → Settings
2. Scroll to "Hero Media URL (Mobile)"
3. Enter a URL or upload a file
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. Refresh the page
6. Check if the value is still there
7. Check the database directly:
   ```sql
   SELECT "heroMediaUrlMobile" FROM "SiteSettings";
   ```

If it's still not saving, check browser console for errors during save.

   ```

## Hero Media URL Logic Explained

### Type: "Both" (Image + Video Overlay)
- **Desktop**: Shows `heroMediaUrl` as background + optional video overlay
- **Mobile**: Shows `heroMediaUrlMobile` if set, otherwise gradient

### Type: "Video"
- **Desktop**: Shows `heroMediaUrl` video
- **Mobile**: Shows `heroMediaUrlMobile` if set, otherwise falls back to desktop video

### Type: "Image"
- **Desktop**: Shows `heroMediaUrl` image
- **Mobile**: Shows `heroMediaUrlMobile` if set, otherwise gradient

**Key Change**: Mobile no longer uses desktop URL as fallback for "both" and "image" types!

## Troubleshooting

### Hero Mobile URL Still Not Saving

1. **Check browser console** for errors when clicking Save
2. **Check network tab** - verify PUT request to `/api/content/settings` includes `heroMediaUrlMobile`
3. **Check backend logs** - look for "Settings update error"
4. **Verify database** - run query to check if field exists:
   ```sql
   \d "SiteSettings"
   ```
5. **Try manual database update**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE "SiteSettings" 
   SET "heroMediaUrlMobile" = 'test-url' 
   WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM "SiteSettings" LIMIT 1);
   ```

### Mobile Cards Still Showing 2 Per Row

1. **Clear browser cache**: Ctrl + Shift + R (hard refresh)
2. **Check screen width**: Must be < 768px to see 1 column
3. **Inspect element**: Verify class is `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3`

### Navigation Buttons Not Showing

1. **Clear cache and refresh**
2. **Check if pages exist**: /about, /tour, /contact routes must be defined
3. **Verify import**: `FaTicketAlt` icon must be imported

✅ Hero mobile URL now works independently (no desktop fallback)  
✅ About, Tour, Contact buttons added to homepage  
✅ Mobile cards layout fixed to 1 per row
